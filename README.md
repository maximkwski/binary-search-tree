- buildTree(array) takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed
- insert(value) adds a new node containing the given value
- delete(value) deletes the node containing the given value
- search(value) returns the node with the given value
- levelOrder(root) traverses the tree in breadth-first level order
- inOrder(root) traverses the tree in inorder depth-first order
- preOrder(root) traverses the tree in preorder depth-first order
- postOrder(root) traverses the tree in postorder depth-first order
- min(root) finds the node with min value
- max(root) finds the node in the tree with maximum value
